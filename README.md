# An implementation of Java JSON Parser

This is a Java library to parse JSON text into Java objects.
This library is compatible with [RFC 8259](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259).

The feature of this library is that it keeps the original JSON text information
in the Java objects. Therefore, for example, your application can show where
exactly (line number & column number) the JSON text has a problem if there is 
a semantic error.
