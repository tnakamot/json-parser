/**
 * Represents a location in a {@link String}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This basically has three properties, position, line and column.
 * Position and column are counted based on Unicode code units, which
 * means that a surrogate pair uses two positions (columns).
 *
 * <p>
 * Position starts from zero, while line and column start from one.
 *
 * <p>
 * A line is considered to be terminated by any one of a line feed
 * ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), or a carriage return followed
 * immediately by a linefeed.
 *
 * <p>
 * Assume this text:
 *
 * <pre>
 *  abc\ndef\r\nghi\rjkl\n\rmn
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Then, the position, line and column of each character are as
 * shown below.
 *
 * <ul>
 *  <li>'a': position = 0,  line = 1, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'b': position = 1,  line = 1, column = 2</li>
 *  <li>'c': position = 2,  line = 1, column = 3</li>
 *  <li>\n : position = 3,  line = 1, column = 4</li>
 *  <li>'d': position = 4,  line = 2, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'e': position = 5,  line = 2, column = 2</li>
 *  <li>'f': position = 6,  line = 2, column = 3</li>
 *  <li>\r : position = 7,  line = 2, column = 4</li>
 *  <li>\n : position = 8,  line = 2, column = 5</li>
 *  <li>'g': position = 9,  line = 3, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'h': position = 10, line = 3, column = 2</li>
 *  <li>'i': position = 11, line = 3, column = 3</li>
 *  <li>\r : position = 12, line = 3, column = 4</li>
 *  <li>'j': position = 13, line = 4, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'k': position = 14, line = 4, column = 2</li>
 *  <li>'l': position = 15, line = 4, column = 3</li>
 *  <li>\n : position = 16, line = 4, column = 4</li>
 *  <li>\r : position = 17, line = 5, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'m': position = 18, line = 6, column = 1</li>
 *  <li>'n': position = 19, line = 6, column = 2</li>
